# Inquisition memo

This is a small static web site that was created for a scavenger hunt. Now it exists as a reference and a good template to create small websites based on Boostrap.

Previous README was used to give hints to people to look through the code as an alternative method of solving this part of scavenger hunt: *Smart move, but now go away, there is nothing here ;)*

	<summary>Solution</summary>

The text on the webpage is encrupted with Caesar cypher of +7 shift. Original text reads as follows:

> To the esteemed members of the holy inquisition:
> 
> We have come to know of a forbidden item that was in progress of being delivered. Luckily, our agents reacted quickly and intercepted it without leaving any traces. You are supposed to retrieve the item that has been temporarily stored in the deaddrop at the location listed below. For extra security, you need to enter the password that you should know from the High Inquisitor and retrieve it as soon as possible, it should not fall into the wrong hands!

The password is hinted from the supposed scout that is part of the organization that opposes the church. This is not part of this website. The password is **crucifix**, which you can actually see from the code.

The information hidden behind the password **kh.kikjlk, i.iikpqqm** is also encrypted with same caesar cipher with the decrypted part looking like this: **da.dbdced, b.bbdijjf**. Also additionally those are letters that represent numbers starting from a-1 to i-9 and j-0: **41.424354, 2.2249006**. That was a location of a package aka the item containing next clues about scavenger hunt.
